# How the data will be collected and where the data will be stored

The data will be collected by using web crawler and raw data will be stored in my personal computer and also on google drive. 

# How the raw data will be named

The raw data will be named as "YYYYMMDD_RawData_describing data contents" and stored as a csv file. 

I will collect a comprehensive annual data set of all the car model marketed from the year 2004 to year 2013 in the Chinese automobile industry. Within each car model, I will collect information of quantity sales of each displacement of that model from 2004-2016 China Auto Market Almanac. For each model displacement, I will also gather price and information on vehicle characteristics. I will use www.autohome.com.cn as the main website to conduct web crawling. 

# How will data be analyzed

Linear regression, random forest, discrete choice model, support vector machine, gradient boosted tree and so on. These approaches may be used to analyze the relationship between sales and vehicle characteristics.

The analysis will also be on Google Drive.

# Where will the analyzed data be stored

Analyzed data will be stored as 'YYYYMMDD_ Analyzed_Data_describing analysis done' both on my computer and on Google Drive.

# How will the data be shared

The raw data may not be shared but the codes for the web crawling could be shared.
