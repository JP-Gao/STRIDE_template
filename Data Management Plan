The data will be collected by using web crawler and raw data will be stored in my personal computer and also on one drive. 
The raw data will be named as "Raw_Data" and stored as a csv file. 

I will collect a comprehensive annual data set of all the car model marketed from the year 2004 to year 2013 in the Chinese
 automobile industry. Within each car model, I will collect information of quantity sales of each displacment of that model 
from 2004-2016 China Auto Market Almanac. For each model displacement, I will also gather price and information on vehicle 
characteristics.

I will use www.autohome.com.cn as the main website to conduct web crawling. 

Analyzed data will be stored as Analyzed_data both on my computer and on OneDrive.

The raw data may not be shared but the codes for the web crawling could be shared.
