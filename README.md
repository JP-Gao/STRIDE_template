The purpose of this project is to predict vehicle sales using historical vehicle transaction data in China vehicle market.
My hypothesis is that for each vehicle make and model, the annual sales or seasonal sales are correlated with the characteristics of the vehicle model, including the vehicle price, purchase tax, type of fuel, curb weight, engine power, drivertrain, number of seats and doors and so on. Using these variables as expalnantory variables in the indirect utility function, the probability of choosing one specific vehicle model will be calculated.

I plan to collect data from *2004-2016 China Auto Market Almanac* and https://www.autohome.com.cn.

I plan to use 2004-2014 data as my training set and 2015~2016 data as my validation set.



Any file or script added to this repository will be added or linked out to storage location from one of the following components:
* Data management plan file (explains how data are to be organized, stored and shared)
* get_raw_data folder (scripts to get the data and a link to the storage of the directly downloaded data with no cleaning)
* analyze_data folder (scripts for any transformation of the raw data and links to the resulting processed dataset )
