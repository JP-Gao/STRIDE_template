## STRIDE_project_template
Setting up a template repository to manage STRIDE projects

The purpose of this project is [].
My hypothesis is [].

I plan to collect data from [] and [] and []. 

I plan to use [] as my test set.

Any file added to this repository will be added or linked out to storage location as one of the following components:
* Data management plan (explains how data are to be organized, stored and shared)
* Raw data (directly downloaded data with no cleaning)
* Analysis (any work done on the data)
* Analyzed data (any transformed raw data)
